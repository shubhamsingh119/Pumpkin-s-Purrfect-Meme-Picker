🐱 Pumpkin's Purrfect Meme Picker

A fun cat-meme generator where users can pick photos or GIFs based on selected emotions.
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

-- Overview

Pumpkin's Purrfect Meme Picker is a simple and interactive web app that displays cat memes according to the user's chosen emotion. You can filter memes by emotion and even pick GIF-only mode for animated fun.
The app uses a modal to display the selected meme and randomly picks one if multiple options match the selected emotion.
